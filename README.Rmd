# pkguse

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of pkguse is to help users take inventory of their most used packages

## Installation

You can install the dev version of pkguse from [Github](https://github.com/mkearney/pkguse) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("mkearney/pkguse")
```

## Example

This is a basic use example:

```{r use}
## load {pkguse}
library(pkguse)

## supply dir locations
p <- pkg_use(c("~/Documents", "~/Dropbox", "~/R"))

## view output (top 25)
print(p, n = 25)
```

The output has methods for `plot`

```{r plot}
## plot pkguse (top 25)
plot(p, n = 25)
```

and `summary`

```{r summary}
summary(p)
```
